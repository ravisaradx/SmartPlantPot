## **🛠️ Main Components**  
1. ESP32 Camera Control  
        Code to manage and operate the ESP32 camera for real-time monitoring.  
2. Front-End Control  
        Code for the user interface and real-time data visualization.  
3. Circuit Control  
        Code to operate sensors and actuators, including:  
        - Soil moisture sensor for automated watering.  
        - DHT22 for humidity monitoring.  
        - LDR for light condition detection.  
        - Water tank level sensor for low-water notifications.  

## **💡 Features**  
Automated Watering: Waters plants when soil is too dry. Real-Time Monitoring: Displays light, humidity, and soil moisture data on a web interface.  Water Level Alerts: Notifies when the water tank is low.
